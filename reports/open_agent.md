## Enterprise Readiness

OAP is enterprise-ready and actively marketed for enterprise automation, with features and documentation supporting production-scale, secure deployments.  
**Note:** As of now, there is no direct, public evidence of specific named enterprises using OAP in production, though all technical and marketing signals indicate it is designed for such use.

Flowise: Endpoints for Retrieving LangGraph Agent Config & Metadata
Flowise provides a robust set of REST API endpoints and tools that allow you to programmatically access, manage, and extract configuration and metadata for LangGraph-based agents. Below is a summary of the key endpoints and mechanisms relevant for retrieving agent details, configuration, and runtime metadata.

1. Core API Endpoints for Agent Management
Endpoint Pattern	Method	Description
/api/v1/flows	GET	List all flows (agent workflows) and their metadata
/api/v1/flows/{flowId}	GET	Retrieve full configuration and metadata for a specific agent/flow
/api/v1/flows/{flowId}	PUT	Update agent/flow configuration
/api/v1/flows/{flowId}	DELETE	Delete an agent/flow
/api/v1/flows	POST	Create a new agent/flow
/api/v1/prediction/{flowId}	POST	Execute an agent/flow and retrieve run metadata, logs, and outputs
Agent/Flow Metadata: Each flow (agent) includes unique identifiers, name, description, tags, creation/update timestamps, owner, and configuration details such as nodes, tools, and parameters.

Run Metadata: When executing a flow, you can retrieve run-specific data including run ID, status, logs, errors, and dynamic input/output.

2. Agent Node and Tool Configuration
Agent Node: Each agent node within a flow can be configured with:

Name, description, and tool assignments

Model parameters (e.g., LLM model, temperature)

Memory and state management options

Knowledge/document store connections

Input/output variable mappings

Tool Configuration: Tools (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OpenAPI Toolkit) are defined with:

Endpoint URL

Input/output schema (JSON schema for parameters and body)

Headers and authentication

Descriptions and usage notes

3. OpenAPI Toolkit for Bulk API Integration
Purpose: Import an OpenAPI YAML file to auto-generate tools for each API endpoint, making all API operations available as agent tools.

Configuration: Specify the YAML file, headers, and custom code for response handling.

Metadata Extraction: Each imported tool exposes its endpoint, method, input/output schema, and description.

4. Example: Retrieving Agent Config and Metadata
List All Agents/Flows:
GET /api/v1/flows
Returns a list of all agent flows with summary metadata.

Get Specific Agent/Flow Config:
GET /api/v1/flows/{flowId}
Returns the full configuration, including nodes, tools, parameters, and metadata.

Execute Agent and Get Run Metadata:
POST /api/v1/prediction/{flowId}
Returns run ID, status, logs, errors, and outputs for a specific execution.

5. Additional Features
Variables and State: Flows can use static and runtime variables, which are accessible via the API and included in the flow configuration.

Environment and Database: Flowise supports configuration via environment variables and can store agent metadata in various databases for enterprise use.

6. Summary Table: Key Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Returns/Action
