  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Always check if the function to be integrated is defined and continuous over the given interval.",
    "Remember: For definite integrals, the constant of integration cancels out \u2013 do not include it.",
    "Practice breaking down complex integrands into simpler forms or use substitution/partial fractions if necessary.",
    "Know when to use geometric interpretation (area) and when to use anti-derivatives (calculation)."
