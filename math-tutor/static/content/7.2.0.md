## A. Definition and Basic Concept

**Core Idea**

Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. That is, instead of finding the derivative given a function, you are given the derivative (say, f(x)) and asked to find an original function F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x). This resulting function F(x) is known as the antiderivative or primitive of f(x). In mathematics, this process is integral to solving problems where the original function is unknown but the rate of change is known.



## B. Examples and Non-Uniqueness of Integrals

**Basic Observations and Examples**

Consider these examples: 
1. The derivative of sin x is cos x, so sin x is an antiderivative of cos x. 
2. The derivative of x³ is 3x², so x³ is an antiderivative of 3x². 
3. The derivative of eˣ is eˣ, so eˣ is its own antiderivative. 
However, note that for any constant C, the derivative of (sin x + C), (x³ + C), and (eˣ + C) is still cos x, 3x², and eˣ, respectively. Thus, the integral or antiderivative of a function is not unique—it always differs by an arbitrary constant.

**Role of the Arbitrary Constant**

Because the derivative of a constant is zero, the set of all possible antiderivatives for a given function f(x) is given by F(x) + C, where F(x) is any one antiderivative and C is any real number. This is called the family of antiderivatives or integrals.



## C. General Representation of Antiderivatives

**Mathematical Representation**

Let F(x) be such that F'(x)=f(x) for all x in some interval I. Then for any real number C, [F(x) + C]' = f(x). Therefore, {F(x) + C, C ∈ ℝ} is the complete set of antiderivatives of f(x) on I. This is why, in integration, the constant of integration is always added in indefinite integrals.

**Functions with Same Derivative**

Suppose two functions g(x) and h(x) have the same derivative in some interval I. Then, if f(x) = g(x) - h(x), we have f'(x) = 0, meaning f(x) is constant on I. Thus, any two functions with the same derivative must differ by a constant. This justifies writing the family of antiderivatives as F(x) + C.



## D. Notation and Terminology

**Integral Symbol and Indefinite Integral**

The notation ∫f(x)dx denotes the indefinite integral (or antiderivative) of f(x) with respect to x. That is, ∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C, where C is an arbitrary constant.

**Important Terminology**

In the expression ∫f(x)dx: 
- f(x) is called the integrand, 
- x is called the variable of integration, 
- ∫ denotes the integral sign, 
- The process is called integration, 
- The result, F(x) + C, is called an integral or antiderivative of f(x), 
- C is called the constant of integration.



## E. Standard Integral Formulae

**Integral Formulae Corresponding to Common Derivatives**

By recalling common derivatives, we can directly write their corresponding integral formulae, which are frequently used in solving JEE problems:
(i) ∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1), and especially ∫dx = x + C
(ii) ∫cos x dx = sin x + C
(iii) ∫sin x dx = -cos x + C
(iv) ∫sec²x dx = tan x + C
(v) ∫cosec²x dx = -cot x + C
(vi) ∫sec x tan x dx = sec x + C
(vii) ∫cosec x cot x dx = -cosec x + C
(viii) ∫1/√(1-x²) dx = sin⁻¹x + C
(ix) ∫1/(1+x²) dx = tan⁻¹x + C
(x) ∫eˣ dx = eˣ + C
(xi) ∫aˣ dx = aˣ/ln a + C (a > 0, a ≠ 1)
(xii) ∫1/x dx = ln|x| + C
Memorize these standard integrals as they are often used as building blocks for more complicated problems.
