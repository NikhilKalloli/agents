  "notes": [
    "First order first degree differential equations appear frequently in engineering, physics, and applied mathematics and often model rate processes.",
    "Separation of variables is a fundamental technique where a differential equation can be decomposed into integrable functions of individual variables.",
    "The notation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\) as a ratio is justified for such manipulations although technically it is a limit form.",
    "Obtaining particular solutions requires initial or boundary conditions to determine the integration constant.",
    "Transforming practical problems, such as compound interest growth, into differential equations allows leveraging calculus methods to find solutions efficiently."

  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Identify whether a differential equation is separable by checking if the right hand side factors into a product of a function of \\( x \\) and a function of \\( y \\).",
    "Rewrite \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = h(y) \\cdot g(x) \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{h(y)} dy = g(x) dx \\) to separate variables properly.",
    "Integrate both sides with respect to their variables carefully, ensuring to include the constant of integration.",
    "Apply initial or boundary conditions after general integration to find the particular solutions.",
    "Relate the mathematical solution back to the physical or practical context of the problem for better understanding."
