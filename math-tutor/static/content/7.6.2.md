## Introduction to Special Types of Standard Integrals by Parts

**Core Idea**

This section focuses on certain standard integrals whose integrands contain algebraic expressions—specifically, quadratics—which can be efficiently tackled using the method of integration by parts or trigonometric substitution. Mastery over these forms equips students with robust techniques for a wide range of integrals, especially those most likely to appear on the JEE examination.



## Integration Techniques for Given Types

**Integrating \( \int (x^2 - a^2) dx \)**

Consider the integral \( I = \int (x^2 - a^2) dx \). One efficient way is to use integration by parts, selecting the constant function 1 as the second function. By parts, let \( u = x^2 - a^2 \) and \( dv = dx \). Then \( du = 2x dx \), \( v = x \). By the formula \( \int u dv = uv - \int v du \):

1. Compute \( uv = (x^2 - a^2)x \).
2. Compute \( \int v du = \int x \cdot 2x dx = \int 2x^2 dx = \frac{2}{3}x^3 \).
3. Thus, \( I = (x^2 - a^2)x - \int 2x^2 dx = x^3 - a^2x - \frac{2}{3}x^3 + C \),
   which simplifies to \( I = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - a^2x + C \).

Alternatively, for more complicated expressions or roots, substitution such as \( x = a \sec \theta \) can be used to transform the integrand into a trigonometric integral.

**Integrating \( \int (x^2 + a^2) dx \)**

Integration by parts can be used similarly here. Often, such integrals are dealt with through algebraic manipulation or by direct substitution if the accompanying terms permit. Remember that for odd powers of x, polynomial division can also be used; for even powers plus constants, try substitution like \( x = a \tan \theta \) to reduce the integral to a simpler trigonometric one. The direct integration yields:
\[ \int (x^2 + a^2) dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + a^2 x + C \].
For more intricate cases—such as when the integral appears as the denominator's square root—use trigonometric substitution.

**Integrating \( \int (a^2 - x^2) dx \)**

A quadratic of the form \( a^2 - x^2 \) invites the substitution \( x = a \sin \theta \), which converts the expression under the integral into trigonometric functions easy to integrate. Direct integration by parts is also possible by letting \( u = a^2 - x^2 \), \( dv = dx \) and proceeding similarly as above.
The result is:
\[ \int (a^2 - x^2) dx = a^2 x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C \].

**Use of Trigonometric Substitution**

Trigonometric substitutions are invaluable for such integrals as they transform algebraic expressions under radicals or powers into standard trigonometric integrals. For example:
- For \( x^2 - a^2 \): use \( x = a \sec \theta \)
- For \( x^2 + a^2 \): use \( x = a \tan \theta \)
- For \( a^2 - x^2 \): use \( x = a \sin \theta \)

Using such substitutions, derivatives become trigonometric functions, and the entire integral often simplifies into a basic form that is easy to integrate. Always revert back to \( x \) at the end using the original substitution.



## Examples Illustrating the Process

**Example 1: \( \int (x^2 + 2x + 5) dx \)**

To evaluate \( \int (x^2 + 2x + 5) dx \), rewrite and simplify:
- Complete the square inside the integrand: \( x^2 + 2x + 5 = (x + 1)^2 + 4 \).
- Let \( y = x + 1 \), so that \( dy = dx \).
- Substitute: \( \int ((x + 1)^2 + 4) dx = \int (y^2 + 4) dy \).
- Integrate: \( \int y^2 dy = \frac{y^3}{3} \) and \( \int 4 dy = 4y \).
- Combine to get \( \frac{y^3}{3} + 4y + C = \frac{(x + 1)^3}{3} + 4(x + 1) + C \).
- If the logarithmic form is needed (as per standard forms involving square roots or trigonometric substitution), refer to specific standard formulas (see 7.6.2(ii) for guidance).

**Example 2: \( \int (x^2 - 2x - 3) dx \)**

Simplify integrand by completing the square:
- \( x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 1)^2 - 4 \).
- Let \( y = x - 1 \), so that \( dy = dx \).
- Substitute: \( \int ((x - 1)^2 - 4) dx = \int (y^2 - 4) dy \).
- Integrate: \( \int y^2 dy = \frac{y^3}{3} \), \( \int -4 dy = -4y \).
- Simplified answer: \( \frac{y^3}{3} - 4y + C = \frac{(x - 1)^3}{3} - 4(x - 1) + C \).

Alternatively, for problems requiring the application of 7.6.2(iii), use trigonometric substitutions and standard forms for the results.
