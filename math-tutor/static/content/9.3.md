## Definition and Identification of Homogeneous Functions

**Core Definition**

A function F(x,y) is called homogeneous of degree n if for any nonzero constant λ, it satisfies the scaling property F(λx, λy) = λ^n F(x,y). Here, n is a real number, often an integer. This definition means when both variables are scaled by the same factor, the function scales by that factor raised to the power n.

**Examples and Non-examples**

For instance, the function F1(x,y) = y^2 + 2xy scales as F1(λx, λy) = λ^2 F1(x,y), so it is homogeneous of degree 2. Similarly, F2(x,y) = 2x - 3y scales linearly (degree 1), while F3(x,y) = cos(y/x) since y/x is scale invariant, has degree 0. However, F4(x,y) = sin x + cos y does not scale as λ^n F(x,y) for any n and thus is not homogeneous.



## Properties and Examples of Homogeneous Functions

**Rewrite Functions in x and y using Degree n**

Homogeneous functions can be expressed in terms of ratios such as y/x or x/y multiplied by x^n or y^n. For example, F1(x,y) = y^2 + 2xy can be expressed as x^2[(y/x)^2 + 2(y/x)] = x^2 h1(y/x), where h1 is a function of y/x only. This confirms degree 2 homogeneity. Similar expressions apply to other functions, confirming their degree and providing forms useful in solving differential equations.

**Identification of Functions Not Homogeneous**

Functions like F4 = sin x + cos y cannot be factored into x^n or y^n multiplied by a function of y/x or x/y for any n, meaning they do not satisfy the homogeneity property. This identifies that differential equations involving such functions are not homogeneous in this sense.



## Forming Homogeneous Differential Equations

**Definition of Homogeneous Differential Equation**

A differential equation dy/dx = F(x,y) is homogeneous if and only if F(x,y) is a homogeneous function of degree zero, which means replacing x and y by λx and λy leaves the function unchanged: F(λx,λy) = F(x,y). This property implies that F(x,y) can be expressed as g(y/x) or h(x/y).

**Verification of Homogeneity**

To verify if the differential equation is homogeneous, replace x and y by λx and λy in F(x,y) and check if the function simplifies to the original function without scaling. For example, in dy/dx = (x+2y)/(x−y), replacing gives the same ratio, showing degree zero homogeneity.



## Method of Solving Homogeneous Differential Equations

**Substitution Strategy**

For a homogeneous differential equation dy/dx = g(y/x), introduce the substitution y = vx where v is a function of x. This converts y into a product of x and v, reducing two variables to one variable function.

**Differentiation after Substitution**

Differentiating y = vx with respect to x gives dy/dx = v + x dv/dx, using the product rule. Replacing dy/dx and y in the original equation results in an equation in terms of v and x, often separable.

**Separation and Integration**

Rearranged properly, the transformed equation takes the form dv/dx = function of v divided by x, allowing separation of variables: dv / [g(v) − v] = dx/x. Integrating both sides leads to the general implicit solution involving logarithmic or other integrals.

**Re-substitution and Solution**

Upon integration, replace v by y/x to return the solution back to original variables, yielding implicit or explicit solutions to the initial differential equation.



## Worked Examples on Homogeneous Differential Equations

**Example 1: Solve (x−y) dy/dx = x + 2y**

Rewrite as dy/dx = (x + 2y)/(x − y). Verify homogeneity by replacing x and y with λx, λy, confirming degree zero. Substitute y = vx, produce dy/dx = v + x dv/dx. Replace in equation and simplify to get x dv/dx = (1 + 2v)/(1 − v) − v = (1 + 2v)/ (1− v) − v. This reduces to a separable equation in v and x. Integrate both sides: ∫ (1 − v) / (v^2 + v +1) dv = ∫ dx/x, solving with partial fractions or appropriate methods. After integration, substitute back v = y/x to get the general solution involving logarithms and inverse tangent functions.

**Example 2: Solve x cos(y/x) dy/dx = y cos(y/x) + x**

Express the equation as dy/dx = [y cos(y/x) + x] / [x cos(y/x)]. The function on RHS is homogeneous degree zero because factors scale equally. Substitute y = vx and differentiate dy/dx = v + x dv/dx. After substitution, simplify to obtain x dv/dx = − v / cos v, where v = y/x. Separate variables and integrate ∫ cos v dv = ∫ dx/x which results in sin v = log|Cx|. Finally, rewrite as sin(y/x) = log|C x|.

**Example 3: Solve 2y e^{x/y} dx + (y−2x e^{x/y}) dy = 0 with x=0 when y=1**

Rewrite the equation and express dy/dx in terms of x and y. Verify homogeneity of degree zero. Use substitution x = vy and differentiate accordingly. After substituting and rearranging, derive y dv/dy = function of v. Separate and integrate to get 2 e^v = − log|y| + C. Substitute back to get implicit solution 2 e^{x/y} + log|y| = C. Apply initial condition x=0, y=1 to find constant C=2, resulting in particular solution 2 e^{x/y} + log|y| = 2.

**Example 4: Family of Curves with Slope dy/dx = (x^2 + y^2)/(2xy)**

Rewrite as dy/dx = (x^2+y^2)/(2xy), which is homogeneous degree zero since numerator and denominator scale as λ^2. Substitute y = vx and differentiate. After substitution, rearrange into separable form in v and x. Integrate both sides to find implicit solution (v^2 -1)x = C, or equivalently x^2 - y^2 = Cx, defining the family of curves satisfying the slope condition.
