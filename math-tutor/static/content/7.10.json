  "notes": [
    "These properties are essential for simplifying and evaluating definite integrals, especially in the context of problems in the JEE syllabus.",
    "Some properties are connected to symmetry, substitution, and the nature (even/odd) of the functions involved.",
    "A strong command of these can reduce computational workload and help spot shortcuts during exams."
  ],
  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Carefully memorize the seven main properties (P0 to P7) as many JEE problems can be greatly simplified using them.",
    "While solving, actively look for ways to apply symmetry (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) and substitution tricks for changing the variable or the limits.",
    "Whenever a question involves an even or odd function, immediately consider P7.",
    "Practice transforming the limits and the integrand as suggested in these properties; it not only helps in evaluation but in proof-based questions."
