## Introduction and Theorem Statement

**Motivation and Use Case**

Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of two functions that are not easily integrable by substitution or direct methods. It is especially useful when the integrand is a product of one function whose derivative simplifies the integrand and another whose integral is easily computable. Typical cases include the product of a polynomial and an exponential, trigonometric, or logarithmic function.

**Mathematical Statement**

If u(x) and v(x) are two differentiable functions of x, then by the product rule of differentiation, we have d(uv)/dx = u dv/dx + v du/dx. Integrating both sides with respect to x, and rearranging gives: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. This is known as the formula for integration by parts.



## Derivation of Integration by Parts (IBP) Formula

**Starting from the Product Rule**

The product rule for differentiation states that if u(x) and v(x) are differentiable, then d(uv)/dx = u dv/dx + v du/dx. By integrating both sides with respect to x: ∫d(uv)/dx dx = ∫u dv/dx dx + ∫v du/dx dx. The left hand side integrates to uv, so: uv = ∫u dv + ∫v du. Rearranging, we obtain the integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.

**Translating to Functions f(x) and g(x):**

Let u = f(x) and dv = g(x) dx. Then du = f′(x) dx and v = ∫g(x) dx. Substituting into the IBP formula yields: ∫f(x)g(x) dx = f(x)∫g(x) dx - ∫f′(x)∫g(x) dx dx. This general formulation is used for computation.



## How to Choose the First and Second Function

**Significance of Order**

The outcome of integration by parts depends crucially on which function is chosen as 'u' (the first function) and which as 'dv' (the second function). The aim is to select 'u' so that its derivative du is simpler than u, and 'dv' so that its integral v is not more complicated than dv.

**LIATE Rule**

Generally, the LIATE rule guides the choice: Logarithmic > Inverse trigonometric > Algebraic > Trigonometric > Exponential. The earliest function in this list present in the product is chosen as the first function (u), while the rest collectively form dv.



## Working Examples of Integration by Parts

**Example 1: ∫x cos x dx**

Let u = x and dv = cos x dx. Then, du = dx and v = ∫cos x dx = sin x. Apply IBP: ∫x cos x dx = x·sin x - ∫sin x dx = x sin x + cos x + C. Here, after applying IBP, the remaining integral is elementary.

**Example 2: ∫x eˣ dx**

Let u = x (algebraic) and dv = eˣ dx (exponential). Then, du = dx, v = eˣ. By IBP: ∫x eˣ dx = x eˣ - ∫eˣ dx = x eˣ - eˣ + C. The result is the product minus the integral of the easier function.

**Example 3: ∫log x dx**

Let u = log x (logarithmic), dv = dx (algebraic, i.e., 1·dx). Then, du = (1/x) dx, v = x. Using IBP: ∫log x dx = x·log x - ∫x·(1/x) dx = x log x - ∫dx = x log x - x + C. The method works even when at first the expression looks like a single function.



## Key Remarks and Special Cases

**Applicability Limits**

Integration by parts does not apply to every product of functions. For example, ∫x sin x dx is manageable, but for ∫x sin x dx where such a product's operator does not yield an elementary function for the derivative (e.g., ∫x sin x dx), the method may not simplify.

**About Constants of Integration**

While integrating the second function to obtain 'v,' adding an arbitrary constant is unnecessary within the IBP process. Any constant included in v will cancel when differentiating and combining terms, showing the constant is already accounted for in the final '+ C'.

**Selection Strategy**

If one function is a polynomial (x^n), typically it is chosen as the first function because differentiation reduces its degree. However, when paired with logarithmic or inverse trigonometric functions, those take priority as the first function due to the LIATE rule.



## Integration of the Type ∫eˣ[f(x) + f′(x)] dx

**Reduction Formula Derivation**

Suppose I = ∫eˣ[f(x) + f′(x)] dx. This can be split as I = ∫eˣf(x) dx + ∫eˣf′(x) dx. Focus on the second term: Use IBP with u = f(x), dv = eˣ dx. Then, du = f′(x) dx, v = eˣ. Thus, ∫f(x) eˣ dx = f(x) eˣ - ∫f′(x) eˣ dx. Arrange: I = ∫eˣ f(x) dx + [f(x) eˣ - ∫f′(x) eˣ dx], which yields I = f(x)eˣ + C. This result enables quick computation of such expressions.



## Additional Examples for Practice

**Example 4: ∫sin⁻¹x·(1/√(1-x²)) dx**

Put u = sin⁻¹x (inverse trigonometric), dv = (1/√(1-x²)) dx. Here, du = 1/√(1-x²) dx, which is the integrand in dv -- so v = x from the integral of dv. By IBP, ∫sin⁻¹x·(1/√(1-x²)) dx = x·sin⁻¹x - ∫x/(√(1-x²)) dx. The integral ∫x/(√(1-x²)) dx can be computed by substitution: Let t = 1-x² ⇒ dt = -2x dx, so x dx = -dt/2. After simplifying and substituting back, the final answer is: x·sin⁻¹x + √(1-x²) + C.

**Example 5: ∫eˣ sin x dx**

Let u = eˣ (exponential), dv = sin x dx (trigonometric). Then du = eˣ dx, v = -cos x. Applying IBP: ∫eˣ sin x dx = -eˣ cos x + ∫eˣ cos x dx. You must then again use IBP on ∫eˣ cos x dx. Eventually, you get a relation involving the original integral, allowing you to solve for it algebraically to obtain: ∫eˣ sin x dx = (1/2)eˣ (sin x - cos x) + C.
