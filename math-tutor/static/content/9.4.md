## Introduction to First Order First Degree Differential Equations

**Formulation**

A first order first degree differential equation is an equation involving the first derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) of an unknown function \( y = y(x) \), expressed in the form \( \frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y) \). The order 'first order' means the highest derivative is the first derivative, and 'first degree' means the derivative appears to the first power only, without higher powers or products with itself.



## Differential Equations with Variables Separable

**Definition**

If the function \( F(x,y) \) can be written as a product of two functions, one solely dependent on \( x \), denoted \( g(x) \), and another solely dependent on \( y \), denoted \( h(y) \), then the differential equation is called a separable variables differential equation. Formally, this means \( \frac{dy}{dx} = h(y) \cdot g(x) \).

**Separation of Variables Technique**

Given \( \frac{dy}{dx} = h(y)g(x) \) and assuming \( h(y) \neq 0 \), we can rearrange as \( \frac{1}{h(y)} dy = g(x) dx \), effectively separating the variables \( y \) and \( x \) on opposite sides of the equation. This enables integrating both sides independently in terms of their respective variables.



## Solution Procedure for Separable Differential Equations

**Integration**

Integrate the separated equation: \( \int \frac{1}{h(y)} dy = \int g(x) dx + C \), where \( C \) is an arbitrary constant. The integrals represent antiderivatives, denoted as \( H(y) = \int \frac{1}{h(y)} dy \) and \( G(x) = \int g(x) dx \). The implicit solution then becomes \( H(y) = G(x) + C \).

**General and Particular Solutions**

The implicit solution represents a family of curves parameterized by \( C \). Specifying an initial condition such as \( y(x_0) = y_0 \) allows determining the particular value of \( C \), producing a unique particular solution satisfying the given condition.



## Examples Demonstrating Separation of Variables Method

**Example 4: Solving a Linear Equation**

Given differential equation: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}(x + 1)(2 - y), y \neq 2 \). Separation yields \( (2 - y) dy = (x + 1) dx \). Integrating: \( \int (2 - y) dy = \int (x + 1) dx \), results in the general solution expressed implicitly as \( x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + C = 0 \), representing a family of curves.

**Example 5: Solving Using Inverse Trigonometric Functions**

Given \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1 + y^2}{1 + x^2} \). After separating variables: \( \frac{dy}{1 + y^2} = \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \). Integrating leads to \( \tan^{-1} y = \tan^{-1} x + C \), an implicit relationship involving inverse tangent functions.

**Example 6: Finding Particular Solution**

Differential equation \( 24 y \, dy = - x \, dx \) rewritten for separation: \( \frac{2 dy}{y} = -4x \, dx \). Integration yields \( ln|y| = -2x^2 + C \) or equivalently \( y = e^{C} e^{-2x^2} \). Applying initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \) determines \( C = 0 \), giving \( y = e^{-2x^2} \) as the particular solution.

**Example 7: Curve Equation from Differential Equation**

From \( x \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x^2 + 1, x \neq 0 \), rewrite as \( dy = \left(2x + \frac{1}{x}\right) dx \). Integrate both terms to find \( y = x^2 + \ln |x| + C \). Initial point \( (1,1) \) fixes \( C = 0 \), yielding the explicit curve equation.

**Example 8: Equation of Curve from Slope Function**

Given slope \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x y^2 \), separate variables as \( \frac{dy}{y^2} = 2x dx \). Integrate \( - y^{-1} = x^2 + C \). Rearranged to \( y = -\frac{1}{x^2 + C} \). Using point \((-2,3)\) finds \( C = -\frac{1}{3} - 4 \), specifying the particular curve.

**Example 9: Application to Continuously Compounded Interest**

Principal \( P \) grows at rate proportional to itself: \( \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{5}{100} P = \frac{P}{20} \). Separate variables: \( \frac{dP}{P} = \frac{dt}{20} \). Integration gives \( \ln P = \frac{t}{20} + C \), or \( P = C' e^{t/20} \). With initial \( P(0) = 1000 \), find doubling time \( t \) from \( 2000 = 1000 e^{t/20} \) leading to \( t = 20 \ln 2 \).
