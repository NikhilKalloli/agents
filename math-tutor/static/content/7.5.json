    "Integration by partial fractions is a crucial technique for integrating rational functions, especially useful for JEE Advanced and Mains.",
    "It is necessary to distinguish between proper and improper rational functions before applying the method.",
    "Solving for the unknowns in partial fractions involves systematic algebra, often equating coefficients or substituting values."
  ],
  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Always check if the rational function is proper. If not, perform polynomial long division first.",
    "Factorize the denominator completely to decide the form of partial fractions.",
    "Set up the partial fraction decomposition according to the degree and type (linear, repeated, irreducible quadratic) of each factor in the denominator.",
    "Solve for unknowns (A, B, C, ...) by equating coefficients, or by plugging in convenient values for x.",
    "Once decomposed, integrate each term using standard formulas and substitution if needed.",
    "In some cases, substitution (like x^2 = y) simplifies the calculation, especially with quadratic denominators."
