    "The substitution method converts a difficult integral into a simpler or standard form by introducing a new variable.",
    "In definite integrals, you can substitute the limits immediately after substituting the variable, thus avoiding back-substitution."

  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Always carefully choose the substitution so that the new integral is easier to evaluate.",
    "Remember to change the limits of integration when you change the variable.",
    "Express dx in terms of the new variable and its differential before substituting."
