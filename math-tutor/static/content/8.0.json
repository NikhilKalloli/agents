    "Integration is essential for calculating areas bounded by curves not handled by basic geometric formulae.",
    "The area under a curve can be visualized and calculated using strips (vertical or horizontal) and integrating.",
    "When the function is below the x-axis, only the absolute value of the definite integral represents the physical area.",
    "For symmetric figures (like circles, ellipses), calculations can be simplified by considering one quarter and multiplying."
  ],
  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Always sketch the region whose area you are calculating and indicate bounds, variables, and symmetry.",
    "Determine whether vertical or horizontal strips (dx or dy integration) will simplify your integral.",
    "Pay close attention to whether the function is positive or negative within your region.",
    "For definite integrals yielding negative values (below x-axis), take their absolute values for the correct area.",
    "Symmetry is a powerful tool\u2014use it to reduce the effort needed by integrating only over part of the region."
