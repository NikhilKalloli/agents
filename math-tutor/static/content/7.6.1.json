  "notes": [
    "Integration by parts is an essential tool for integrating products of functions.",
    "The choice of first and second function is critical and often dictated by the LIATE rule (Logarithmic, Inverse trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential).",
    "The method is not universally applicable, and the need for good algebraic manipulations arises in non-standard cases."
  ],
  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Always identify clearly the two functions involved in the product.",
    "Use the LIATE rule for deciding which function to take as first: (L)ogarithmic > (I)nverse trigonometric > (A)lgebraic > (T)rigonometric > (E)xponential.",
    "After applying integration by parts, always check if the resulting integral is simpler than the original.",
    "Be careful about constants of integration when combining results."
