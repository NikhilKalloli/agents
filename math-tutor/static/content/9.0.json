    "Differential equations involve derivatives of dependent variables with respect to independent variables, distinguishing them from regular algebraic or trigonometric equations which contain only variables.",
    "Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) involve derivatives with respect to a single independent variable, whereas Partial Differential Equations involve multiple independent variables.",
    "Understanding the order and degree of a differential equation is critical as it characterizes the complexity of the equation and influences solution methods.",
    "Order of a differential equation is always a positive integer representing the highest derivative's order present in the equation.",
    "Degree is defined only when the equation is a polynomial in derivatives; it is the highest power of the highest order derivative term.",
    "Notation using primes (\u2032, \u2032\u2032, \u2032\u2032\u2032) is handy for lower order derivatives, while the notation y^(n) is preferred for nth order derivatives to avoid ambiguity."

  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Review basic differentiation concepts as differential equations fundamentally connect a function to its derivatives.",
    "Identify clearly which variable is independent and which is dependent to classify differential equations correctly.",
    "When determining order, carefully find the highest derivative present in the equation.",
    "For degree, ensure the equation is polynomial in derivatives; if not, the degree is undefined.",
    "Practice converting common equations involving derivatives into differential equation form to develop familiarity.",
    "Use notation consistently to avoid confusion between different orders of derivatives."
