    "These properties are fundamental for solving integration problems in JEE.",
    "Understanding these will make manipulating and solving integrals much easier in calculus.",
    "The arbitrary constant of integration is a central aspect of indefinite integrals, and knowing when and how to use it is essential."
  ],
  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Carefully relate each property to its equivalent property in differentiation.",
    "Practice several examples for each property to solidify understanding.",
    "When integrating, always remember to add the constant of integration, except when asked for a particular solution.",
    "Use the method of inspection for quick integration when possible.",
    "For complex expressions, try decomposing into simpler terms and apply linearity and homogeneity."
