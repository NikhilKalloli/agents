## Key Properties of Definite Integrals

**P0: Change of Variable (Direct Substitution)**

If \( x = t \), then \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^b f(t) dt \). This property simply states that you can change the variable inside a definite integral as long as the limits and dx term change correspondingly. It's the one-to-one substitution property which is frequently used in transformations.

**P1: Reversal of Limits**

If the order of limits in a definite integral is reversed, the integral changes its sign: \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = -\int_b^a f(x) dx \). In particular, if the lower and upper limits are the same, the integral is zero: \( \int_a^a f(x) dx = 0 \).

**P2: Additivity Over Intervals**

The definite integral can be split at an intermediate point \( c \) between \( a \) and \( b \): \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx \). This property follows from the fact that the net area from \( a \) to \( b \) is the sum of areas from \( a \) to \( c \) and from \( c \) to \( b \).

**P3: Integral of a Shifted Argument**

The definite integral has the property \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^b f(a + b - x) dx \). This is a crucial symmetry result and is especially useful when the function has properties (such as evenness or oddness) or is symmetric about the midpoint of the interval.

**P4: Symmetric Interval with a Translation**

\( \int_0^a f(x) dx = \int_0^a f(a - x) dx \). This is a special case of P3, demonstrating symmetry around the midpoint for intervals that start from zero.

**P5: Double-Length Interval Property**

For \( \int_0^{2a} f(x) dx \), it breaks down as: \( \int_0^a f(x) dx + \int_0^a f(2a - x) dx \), that is, the integral from 0 to 2a is the sum of the integral from 0 to a and from a to 2a (after a reflection transformation).

**P6: Use With Symmetric Functions**

If \( f(2a-x) = f(x) \), that is, f is symmetric about \( x=a \), then \( \int_0^{2a} f(x) dx = 2 \int_0^a f(x) dx \). If \( f(2a-x) = -f(x) \), i.e., f is anti-symmetric about \( x=a \), then \( \int_0^{2a} f(x) dx = 0 \).

**P7: Even and Odd Functions On Symmetric Intervals**

For \( \int_{-a}^a f(x) dx \):
(a) If \( f(x) \) is even (i.e., \( f(-x)=f(x) \)), then \( \int_{-a}^a f(x) dx = 2\int_0^a f(x) dx \).
(b) If \( f(x) \) is odd (i.e., \( f(-x) = -f(x) \)), then \( \int_{-a}^a f(x) dx = 0 \).



## Proofs of Definite Integral Properties

**Proof of P0**

This comes directly from the substitution method. If you set \( x = t \), then \( dx = dt \) and thus the integral \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^b f(t) dt \). This is the basis of changing variables inside definite integrals.

**Proof of P1: Reversal of limits**

If \( F(x) \) is the antiderivative of \( f(x) \), then by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) \) and \( \int_b^a f(x) dx = F(a) - F(b) = -[F(b) - F(a)] = -\int_a^b f(x) dx \). If \( a = b \), the area is clearly zero.

**Proof of P2: Additivity Over Intervals**

For \( \int_a^b f(x) dx \), split the interval at \( c \): \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) = [F(b) - F(c)] + [F(c) - F(a)] = \int_c^b f(x) dx + \int_a^c f(x) dx \). This shows that the integral from a to b is the sum of a to c and c to b.

**Proof of P3: Integral of a Shifted Argument**

Let \( t = a + b - x \), so \( x = a + b - t \), \( dx = -dt \). When \( x = a \), \( t = b \); when \( x = b \), \( t = a \). So, \( \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_b^a f(a + b - t) (-dt) = \int_a^b f(a + b - x) dx \) (by adjusting the sign with the limit reversal).

**Proof of P4: Symmetric Interval**

Let \( t = a - x \), so \( x = a - t \), \( dx = -dt \). When x=0, t=a; when x=a, t=0. The integral becomes \( \int_0^a f(a-x) dx = \int_a^0 f(t) (-dt) = \int_0^a f(t) dt \) (as limits are reversed and the sign flips).

**Proof of P5: Double-Length Interval**

By additivity (P2): \( \int_0^{2a} f(x) dx = \int_0^a f(x) dx + \int_a^{2a} f(x) dx \). For the second term, let \( x = a + t \), \( t \) goes 0 to a as x goes a to 2a. Then, \( f(x) = f(a + t) = f(2a - (a - t)) = f(2a - x) \), so \( \int_a^{2a} f(x) dx = \int_0^a f(2a-x) dx \), hence \( \int_0^{2a} f(x) dx = \int_0^a f(x) dx + \int_0^a f(2a-x) dx \).

**Proof of P6: Symmetric/Antisymmetric Functions**

From P5: \( \int_0^{2a} f(x) dx = \int_0^a f(x) dx + \int_0^a f(2a-x) dx \).
- If \( f(2a-x) = f(x) \), then total is \( 2\int_0^a f(x) dx \).
- If \( f(2a-x) = -f(x) \), then total is zero.

**Proof of P7: Even and Odd Functions**

Split \( \int_{-a}^a f(x) dx = \int_{-a}^0 f(x) dx + \int_0^a f(x) dx \). With substitution \( x = -t \) in first integral: \( dx = -dt \), when x = -a, t = a; x = 0, t = 0: \( \int_{-a}^{0} f(x) dx = \int_{a}^{0} f(-t)(-dt) = \int_0^a f(-t) dt \).
- If f(x) even: \( f(-t) = f(t) \), sum becomes \( 2\int_0^a f(x) dx \).
- If f(x) odd: \( f(-t) = -f(t) \), sum becomes zero.



## Examples Based on Definite Integral Properties

**Example 28: Evaluate \( \int_{-1}^2 (x^3 - x) dx \)**

First, analyze the function to note its sign in different intervals for better splitting, though here direct application suffices. Use additivity:
\( \int_{-1}^2 (x^3-x) dx = \int_{-1}^0 (x^3-x) dx + \int_0^1 (x^3-x) dx + \int_1^2 (x^3-x) dx \). Integrate each term, combine results, and sum:
- \( \int x^3 dx = \frac{x^4}{4} \)
- \( \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} \)
Calculate each definite piece and add for the answer.

**Example 29: Evaluate \( \int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin^2 x dx \)**

Since \( \sin^2 x \) is even, use P7(i): \( \int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin^2 x dx = 2\int_0^\pi \sin^2 x dx \). Use double-angle identity: \( \sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2} \). Integrate and evaluate from 0 to \( \pi \).

**Example 30: Evaluate \( \int_0^\pi \frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x} dx \)**

Let I be the integral. Apply P4 with substitution \( x' = \pi - x \), and use identities for sine and cosine at \( \pi - x \). Add the original and transformed forms to simplify to a calculable integral.

**Example 31: Evaluate \( \int_{-1}^1 \sin^5 x \cos^4 x dx \)**

Check the symmetry: \( f(-x) = \sin^5(-x) \cos^4(-x) = -\sin^5 x \cos^4 x = -f(x) \), so function is odd. By P7(ii), the integral over symmetric limits is zero.

**Example 32: Evaluate \( \int_0^{4\pi} \frac{\sin x}{2 + \sin x + \cos x} dx \)**

Write I for the integral. Apply P4 to transform and create a pair of integrals with original and transformed arguments. Adding the two gives a solution that simplifies by symmetry or periodicity.

**Example 33: Evaluate \( \int_{\pi/3}^{\pi/6} \frac{1}{\tan x + \cot x} dx \)**

Let I be the integral. Use P3 with a shift: \( f(x) \to f(a + b - x) \), gives the same integral but transforms the denominator in a symmetric way. Adding both forms, you can simplify and solve the resulting integral directly.

**Example 34: Evaluate \( \int_0^{\pi/2} \log (\sin x) dx \)**

Let I denote the integral. Apply P4 to get a similar integral involving \( \log(\cos x) \), sum these two to get \( 2I \), which by the identity \( \sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x \), leads to substituting and reducing the interval. Eventually, after adjustment, the final value is \( - \frac{\pi}{2} \log 2 \).
