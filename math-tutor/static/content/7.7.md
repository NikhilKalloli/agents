## Definition and Notation of Definite Integral

**Mathematical Notation**

A definite integral is written as ∫[a to b] f(x) dx, where:
- 'f(x)' is the integrand, the function you want to integrate.
- 'a' is the lower limit of integration (the start point on the x-axis).
- 'b' is the upper limit of integration (the endpoint on the x-axis).
This integral gives a specific numerical value that represents, among other things, the area under the curve of f(x) from x = a to x = b (assuming the function remains above the x-axis).

**Uniqueness**

Unlike indefinite integrals (which represent a family of antiderivative functions plus an arbitrary constant), a definite integral always produces a single, unique value, provided the function is continuous on [a, b].

**Limit as a Sum**

A definite integral can also be interpreted as the limit of a Riemann sum. That is,

∫[a to b] f(x) dx = lim (n→∞) Σ[k=1 to n] f(x_k) Δx,

where the interval [a, b] is divided into n subintervals of width Δx, and x_k is a sample point in the k-th subinterval. This approach connects the idea of integral as an accumulation of infinitely many, infinitely small products.



## Interpretation as Area and the Area Function

**Geometric Interpretation**

The integral ∫[a to b] f(x) dx is interpreted as the area under the curve y = f(x) between x = a and x = b, above the x-axis if f(x) > 0 in that interval. If the function goes below the x-axis, the integral gives the net signed area (areas below the axis count as negative).

**Area Function Definition**

If we fix the lower limit as 'a' and let the upper limit be variable 'x', then the function A(x) = ∫[a to x] f(t) dt is called the area function. It represents the area from a to the variable point x under the curve y = f(t). This concept is crucial for understanding the connection to the derivative (see the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).



## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Statement and Meaning

**First Fundamental Theorem**

Let f be continuous on [a, b], and let A(x) = ∫[a to x] f(t) dt. Then:

A'(x) = f(x) for all x in [a, b].

Interpretation: The derivative of the area function A(x) gives back the original function f(x). This establishes a profound connection between the processes of integration and differentiation; that is, they are inverse operations.

**Second Fundamental Theorem**

Let f be a continuous function defined on [a, b], and let F(x) be any one antiderivative of f(x) (i.e., F'(x) = f(x)). Then:

∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) – F(a)

In words: The definite integral of f(x) over [a, b] is the difference between the values of any antiderivative F evaluated at b and a. This theorem allows you to compute definite integrals directly using anti-differentiation.

**Impact**

This theorem provides a direct, efficient way to compute the area under a curve without having to compute limits of sums. The key task becomes finding an antiderivative F for the given integrand f.



## Working with Definite Integrals: Steps and Remarks

**Steps for Evaluation**

1. Find the indefinite integral of the given function; i.e., find F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x).
2. Do not include the constant of integration (C). It cancels when you evaluate F(b) – F(a).
3. Substitute the upper limit b into F(x), then the lower limit a into F(x), and subtract: F(b) – F(a).

Note: For definite integrals, the only requirement is that f(x) must be defined and continuous on [a, b].

**Continuity and Domain Issues**

Be careful: The function to be integrated must remain well-defined and continuous over the entire interval [a, b]. For example, integrating 1/(x^2 – 1) over the interval [–2, 3] is not valid, because the integrand is not defined where x = ±1, which fall inside the interval.



## Examples with Stepwise Solution

**Polynomials: ∫[2 to 3] x^2 dx**

Step 1: Find the antiderivative of x^2, which is (1/3)x^3.
Step 2: Apply limits: F(b) – F(a) = (1/3)(3)^3 – (1/3)(2)^3 = (1/3)(27 – 8) = (1/3)(19) = 19/3.

**Algebraic Expressions: ∫[4 to 9] 2x(30 – x^2) dx**

Step 1: Let t = 30 – x^2, so dt = –2x dx, hence 2x dx = –dt.
Step 2: The integral becomes –∫[t1 to t2] t dt = –1/2 t^2 | from x = 4 to x = 9.
For x = 9, t = 30 – 81 = –51; for x = 4, t = 30 – 16 = 14.
Evaluate: [–1/2((–51)^2 – 14^2)] = –1/2(2601 – 196) = –1/2(2405) = –1202.5.
Note: Match limits correctly and adjust for negative signs as needed.

**Rational Functions via Partial Fractions: ∫[1 to 2] 1/[(x + 1)(x + 2)] dx**

Step 1: Express the integrand in partial fractions:
1/[(x + 1)(x + 2)] = A/(x + 1) + B/(x + 2). Solving, A = 1, B = –1.
So the integral is ∫ (1/(x + 1) – 1/(x + 2)) dx = ln|x + 1| – ln|x + 2|.
Step 2: Apply the limits:
F(2) – F(1) = [ln 3 – ln 4] – [ln 2 – ln 3] = ln(3/4) – ln(2/3) = ln[(3/4)/(2/3)] = ln(9/8).

**Trigonometric Integrals: ∫[0 to π/4] sin2t cos2t dt**

Step 1: Let u = sin 2t, so du = 2 cos 2t dt, so cos 2t dt = du/2.
Thus, ∫ (sin 2t)^3 cos 2t dt = ∫ u^3 du/2 = (1/8) u^4 + C = (1/8) (sin 2t)^4.
Step 2: Apply limits t = 0: sin(0) = 0; t = π/4: sin(π/2) = 1.
So Apply: [(1/8)(1)^4 – (1/8)(0)^4] = 1/8 – 0 = 1/8.
Therefore, the definite integral evaluates to 1/8.
