## Example 3: Area bounded by the line y = 3x + 2, the x-axis, and ordinates x = -1 and x = 1

**Understanding the Problem and Sketching the Region**

We are asked to find the area enclosed by the straight line y = 3x + 2, the x-axis (y=0), and the vertical lines (ordinates) x = -1 and x = 1. First, plot the line y = 3x + 2. It is a straight line with slope 3 and y-intercept at (0,2). To find where it crosses the x-axis, set y=0: 0 = 3x + 2 => x = -2/3. This means between x = -1 and x = -2/3, the line is below the x-axis (as y < 0), and between x = -2/3 and x = 1, the line is above the x-axis (y > 0). Draw vertical lines at x = -1 and x = 1 to complete the bounded region. The region is therefore split into two subregions: one where y < 0 (from x = -1 to x = -2/3), and one where y > 0 (from x = -2/3 to x = 1).

**Setting Up the Integrals and Decomposing the Region**

Since the regions above and below the x-axis need to be considered separately (to keep all areas positive), we set up two definite integrals: (i) From x = -1 to x = -2/3, the area under the line but above the x-axis (note the value is negative, but we take the modulus), and (ii) From x = -2/3 to x = 1, the area above the x-axis up to the line. The combined required area is: Area = |-∫_{x=-1}^{x=-2/3} (3x + 2) dx| + ∫_{x=-2/3}^{x=1} (3x + 2) dx.

**Calculation of the Integrals**

Compute the definite integrals:
1. For x in [-1, -2/3], integrate (3x + 2): ∫ (3x + 2) dx = (3/2)x^2 + 2x. So,
A1 = |-[(3/2)x^2 + 2x] from x = -1 to -2/3| = |[(3/2)(-2/3)^2 + 2(-2/3)] - [(3/2)(-1)^2 + 2(-1)]| = |[(3/2)*(4/9) - (4/3)] - [(3/2)*(1) - 2]| = |[(2/3) - (4/3)] - [(3/2) - 2]| = |(-2/3) - (-1/2)| = |(-2/3) + (1/2)| = |-4/6 + 3/6| = |-1/6| = 1/6.
2. For x in [-2/3, 1], calculate: A2 = [(3/2)x^2 + 2x] from x = -2/3 to x = 1 = [(3/2)*1^2 + 2*1] - [(3/2)*(-2/3)^2 + 2*(-2/3)] = (3/2 + 2) - (2/3 - 4/3) = (7/2) - (-2/3) = (7/2 + 2/3). Convert to common denominator: (21/6 + 4/6) = 25/6. But this must be interpreted with the calculation done carefully. 
Alternatively, using their approach:
Area = [ (3/2)x^2 + 2x ] from -1 to 1
= [ (3/2) * 1^2 + 2*1 ] - [ (3/2)*(-1)^2 + 2*(-1) ]
= [3/2 + 2] - [3/2 - 2] = (7/2) - (-1/2) = 4
So sum the two positive contributions: Area = 1/6 + 25/6 = 26/6 = 13/3.
But, their formula splits it as:
Area = [ value from -1 to -2/3 ] + [ value from -2/3 to 1 ] = 1/6 + 25/6 = 26/6 = 13/3.

**Final Answer and Interpretation**

The area of the region bounded by the line y = 3x + 2, the x-axis, and the ordinates x = -1 and x = 1 is 13/3 square units. Always ensure to check the sign and interpret the final area as a positive value, regardless of which side of the x-axis the region lies.



## Example 4: Area bounded by the curve y = cos x, x-axis, and vertical lines x = 0 and x = 2π

**Understanding the Curve and the Bounded Region**

The function y = cos x oscillates between 1 and -1 as x goes from 0 to 2π. Plot cos x from x = 0 to x = 2π: it starts at y = 1 (at x = 0), descends to y = -1 at x = π, and returns to y = 1 at x = 2π. The x-axis divides this curve into regions above (where cos x > 0) and below (where cos x < 0) the x-axis. To find the total area between the curve and the x-axis in this interval, we consider the positive area above as well as the (absolute value of) the area below the x-axis. This involves splitting the interval at the points where cos x = 0, i.e., at x = π/2, 3π/2. However, due to symmetry and the function's periodicity, calculating separately for each region as per intervals makes the calculation easier.

**Splitting the Region and Setting Up the Integrals**

The interval [0, 2π] can be split into three regions based on the sign of cos x and the limits where it crosses the x-axis (at x = π/2 and 3π/2): 
- Region 1: x = 0 to x = π/2, cos x ≥ 0
- Region 2: x = π/2 to x = 3π/2, cos x ≤ 0
- Region 3: x = 3π/2 to x = 2π, cos x ≥ 0
Therefore, the required area is:
Area = ∫_{0}^{π/2} cos x dx + |∫_{π/2}^{3π/2} cos x dx| + ∫_{3π/2}^{2π} cos x dx.
Absolute value is taken over the second integral since in that interval cos x is negative, but area is taken as positive.

**Calculating the Areas of Each Region**

Integrate cos x over each interval:
I1 = ∫ cos x dx from 0 to π/2 = sin x | from 0 to π/2 = sin(π/2) - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1
I2 = ∫ cos x dx from π/2 to 3π/2 = sin x | from π/2 to 3π/2 = sin(3π/2) - sin(π/2) = (-1) - (1) = -2 (take modulus) → Area = 2
I3 = ∫ cos x dx from 3π/2 to 2π = sin x | from 3π/2 to 2π = sin(2π) - sin(3π/2) = 0 - (-1) = 1
Sum up all positive area contributions: Area = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

**Final Answer and Geometric Interpretation**

Thus, the total area bounded by y = cos x, the x-axis, between x = 0 and x = 2π is 4 square units. Note that this is the sum of the positive and absolute values of the negative areas under the curve. This principle generalizes to other periodic functions and is crucial for problems involving oscillating curves.
