    "Always visualize the bounded region by making a rough sketch of the curve and lines involved.",
    "For each example, identify the intersection points and the respective limits of integration.",
    "Remember to consider regions above and below the x-axis separately, as areas below the x-axis give negative values in definite integrals."

  "tips_to_approach": [
    "Draw a clear diagram showing intersections and bounded regions before applying integration.",
    "Divide the area into simpler sub-regions if the function crosses the x-axis, handling positive and negative contributions correctly.",
    "When integrating, always substitute the upper and lower limits correctly and interpret the result as a positive area."
