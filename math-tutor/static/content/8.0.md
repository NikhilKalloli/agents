## 8.1 Introduction

**Background: Geometry and Area Formulae**

In elementary geometry, you learn formulae to find the area of simple shapes—like triangles (1/2 × base × height), rectangles (length × breadth), trapezia, and circles (πr²). These formulae are foundational in real-world applications, such as calculating land areas, floor surfaces, or any physically bounded region where the boundaries are straight lines or simple curves whose equations are known.

**Limitation of Elementary Formulae**

The limitation arises when the region is bounded by a curve, for example, the area under y = f(x) between x = a and x = b. Basic geometric formulae cannot be applied to arbitrary curves. Instead, we need a method to sum up infinitely many infinitesimally thin slices under the curve - this leads us to integral calculus.

**Introduction to Integral Calculus**

Integral calculus provides the mathematical framework to calculate the area under a curve (and much more), by considering the area as a sum (integral) of infinitesimally small pieces. This approach generalizes the idea of ‘area’ to non-rectilinear boundaries. Specifically, definite integrals allow us to rigorously calculate the region bounded by curves, the x-axis (or y-axis), and given boundaries (x = a, x = b, etc.).

**Applications Covered in this Chapter**

In this chapter, we focus on how to use integrals to find: (1) area under simple curves, (2) area between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas, and ellipses (in standard forms), and (3) area bounded by such curves.



## 8.2 Area under Simple Curves

**Integral as Area: Defining the Area under a Curve**

Suppose you are given a curve y = f(x) bounded between x = a and x = b and the x-axis. To calculate the area under this curve, imagine dividing the entire region into a large number of very thin vertical strips. Each strip at a point x has width dx (an infinitesimal change in x) and height y = f(x), so its area, dA, is approximately y dx. 
Then, the total area A is the sum (integral) of all these infinitesimal strip areas from x = a to x = b: A = ∫ (from a to b) y dx = ∫ (from a to b) f(x) dx. This is the definition of the definite integral as an area.

**Horizontal Strips: Area using dy**

In some situations, it is easier to divide the region into thin horizontal strips instead. If the curve is given as x = g(y), and you want the area between y = c and y = d (and the y-axis), then the strip's width is dy and length x = g(y). The area dA of such a strip is x dy, where x = g(y). The total area is then: A = ∫ (from c to d) x dy = ∫ (from c to d) g(y) dy.

**Handling Curves below the x-axis**

If the curve y = f(x) lies below the x-axis for some or all parts of [a, b], then f(x) < 0 there. When you compute ∫ (from a to b) f(x) dx, this value will be negative. However, area as a physical quantity must be positive, so we take the absolute value of the integral in such cases. For regions where the curve crosses the x-axis, split the integration at the points of intersection to account for positive and negative contributions, then take the sum of absolute values as required.

**Example 1: Area Enclosed by a Circle**

Let’s say the circle is given by x² + y² = a². The area inside the circle is what we seek. By symmetry, we can compute the area in the first quadrant and multiply by 4. For the sector in the first quadrant, y ranges from 0 to sqrt(a² - x²), and x ranges from 0 to a.
So, area in first quadrant = ∫ (from x = 0 to x = a) sqrt(a² - x²) dx.
Using substitution (let x = a sin θ), the integral simplifies and eventually yields (πa²)/4 for the quadrant, so total area = 4 × (πa²/4) = πa² — confirming the familiar result via calculus.

**Example 2: Area Enclosed by an Ellipse**

Ellipse: x²/a² + y²/b² = 1. By symmetry, area in the first quadrant is calculated and multiplied by 4 for the total area. y = b sqrt(1 - x²/a²). Area in first quadrant = ∫ (from x = 0 to x = a) b sqrt(1 - x²/a²) dx. Set x = a sin θ (so dx = a cos θ dθ). When x goes from 0 to a, θ goes from 0 to π/2.
Substituting, the integral simplifies to (ab/4) × π, so total area = 4 × (ab/4) × π = πab, the well-known area formula for an ellipse.

**Alternative Approach: Horizontal Strips**

Sometimes the calculation is easier by considering horizontal strips. For the circle, x = sqrt(a² - y²), and so: Area in first quadrant = ∫ (from y = 0 to y = a) sqrt(a² - y²) dy. Similarly, for the ellipse, x = a sqrt(1 - y²/b²). These integrals often result in the same values (due to symmetry), and sometimes computation is more straightforward by this method.
