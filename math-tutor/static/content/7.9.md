## Introduction to Definite Integral by Substitution

**Purpose of Substitution**

In the context of definite integrals, substitution is a method used to simplify the integration process. Often, the direct integration of a given function is not straightforward. The method of substitution transforms the integral into an easier or standard form by introducing a new variable (commonly t or y) which is a function of the original variable x (such as t = f(x)). This process allows us to apply the basic integration formulas more comfortably.

**Indefinite vs. Definite Integration**

While substitution is applicable to both indefinite and definite integrals, in the case of definite integrals, there is an additional step: the limits (or bounds) of the integral must also be converted to the new variable. This ensures the evaluation remains consistent and accurate in the new variable's domain.



## Step-by-Step Procedure for Substitution in Definite Integrals

**Step 1: Substitution (Change of Variable)**

Suppose you are given a definite integral \( \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \). Identify a suitable substitution, such as y = f(x) or x = g(y), which will simplify the original integrand. Find the differential (dy or dt) in terms of dx to completely change the integral into the new variable.

**Step 2: Integral Transformation**

With the substitution made, rewrite the integrand and dx in terms of the new variable and its differential. Do not include the constant of integration since you are dealing with a definite integral (where the answer is a value, not a family of functions).

**Step 3: Changing Limits**

Transform the original limits of integration (in x) into the new variable (y or t). Specifically, calculate the new lower and upper bounds by plugging the original x-limits into the substitution equation. This ensures the new definite integral is set up correctly.

**Step 4: Final Calculation**

Now compute the definite integral with respect to the new variable and its updated limits. The value obtained is the value of the original definite integral.

**Alternative (Traditional) Approach**

In the usual method for indefinite integrals, after integrating in the new variable, one would substitute back in terms of x before finding the values at the original limits. For definite integrals, you can skip back-substitution if you update the limits during substitution itself.



## Remarks and Shortcut

**Efficiency in the Substitution Method**

For definite integrals, a time-saving approach is to immediately change the integration limits to the values corresponding to the new variable after performing the substitution. This avoids the somewhat tedious process of reverting back to the original variable after integrating.

**Key Principle**

Once the substitution is done and the limits changed, you can directly evaluate the new definite integral within the substituted limits. This maintains correctness and efficiency, particularly in examination settings like JEE.



## Worked Examples

**Example 1: \( \int_{-1}^{1} x^4 (x^5 + 1)^2 dx \)**

Let's follow the substitution method step-by-step for this example:

1. **Set up the substitution:** Let t = x^5 + 1. Then differentiate both sides with respect to x: \( dt = 5x^4 dx \), which gives \( x^4 dx = \frac{dt}{5} \).

2. **Rewrite the integral:** The integrand \( x^4 (x^5 + 1)^2 dx \) becomes \( (t)^2 \cdot \frac{dt}{5} = \frac{1}{5} t^2 dt \).

3. **Change limits:**
   - When x = -1, t = (-1)^5 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0.
   - When x = 1, t = (1)^5 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

   So, new limits are t = 0 to t = 2.

4. **Integrate:** \( \int_{0}^{2} \frac{1}{5} t^2 dt = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{t^3}{3} \Bigg|_{0}^{2} = \frac{1}{15} [t^3]_{0}^{2} = \frac{1}{15} (8 - 0) = \frac{8}{15} \).

Therefore, \( \int_{-1}^{1} x^4 (x^5 + 1)^2 dx = \frac{8}{15} \).

**Note:** This process can be done more traditionally by first integrating, substituting back for x, and then applying the original limits, but direct use of new limits is recommended for speed and clarity in exams.

**Example 2: \( \int_{0}^{1} 2 \tan^{-1}x \cdot \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx \)**

Step 1: Use substitution t = \tan^{-1}x. Differentiating both sides, we get \( dt = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} dx \), which implies \( dx = (1 + x^2) dt \), or rearranged \( \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} = dt \).

Step 2: Substitute limits:
- When x = 0, \( t = \tan^{-1}0 = 0 \).
- When x = 1, \( t = \tan^{-1}1 = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

Step 3: Rewrite the integral using these substitutions:
\( \int_{x=0}^{x=1} 2 \tan^{-1}x \cdot \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = 2 \int_{t=0}^{t=\pi/4} t dt \).

Step 4: Integrate:
\( 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/4} t dt = 2 \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{\pi/4} = \left[ t^2 \right]_{0}^{\pi/4} = \left( \frac{\pi^2}{16} - 0 \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \).

Therefore, \( \int_{0}^{1} 2 \tan^{-1}x \cdot \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \).
