## A. Standard Integral Formulae and Their Derivation

**Key Results to Memorize**

Certain integrals involving quadratics occur very frequently in exams. These are:

1. \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 - a^2} = \frac{1}{2a} \log \left| \frac{x - a}{x + a} \right| + C \)
2. \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 + a^2} = \frac{1}{a} \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C \)
3. \( \int \frac{dx}{a^2 - x^2} = \frac{1}{2a} \log \left| \frac{a + x}{a - x} \right| + C \)
4. \( \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C \)
5. \( \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} = \log \left| x + \sqrt{x^2 + a^2} \right| + C \)

For each result, you should know what substitution(s) were done to derive them and in what context to use each.

**Derivation Using Algebraic Manipulation or Trigonometric Substitution**

For example, \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 + a^2} \): substitute \( x = a \tan \theta \), \( dx = a \sec^2 \theta d\theta \), the denominator becomes \( a^2 \sec^2 \theta \), and the integral simplifies to \int d\theta = \theta + C. Then express \theta in terms of x, so \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(x/a) \).

Similarly, for \( \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} \), use \( x = a \sin \theta \), and the square root becomes \( a \cos \theta \), giving after simplification \( \int d\theta = \theta + C \), which leads back to \( \sin^{-1}(x/a) \).

For rational integrals, algebraic decomposition and completing the square are useful for matching the given integral to the correct formula.



## B. Reduction to Standard Forms (Completing the Square)

**Completing the Square**

When the denominator of an integral is a quadratic expression, for example, \( ax^2 + bx + c \), you should express it as \( a(x + h)^2 + k \) where

- \( h = \frac{b}{2a} \)
- \( k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \)

This transformation is crucial to bring the quadratic to the form required by standard integrals, i.e., \( x^2 + a^2 \) or \( x^2 - a^2 \).

For example, \( x^2 - 6x + 13 = (x - 3)^2 + 4 \). Now match the structure to the standard result \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 + a^2} \).

**Variable Substitutions**

When you have forms like \( (x + h)^2 + k^2 \), let \( t = x + h \), so that \( dt = dx \), which reduces the integral to a basic standard integral.
Also, in case of square roots or forms involving \( a^2 - x^2 \) or \( a^2 + x^2 \), using \( x = a \sin \theta \) or \( x = a \tan \theta \) often results in significant simplification.



## C. Integration by Resolving the Numerator

**Expressing the Numerator in Terms of the Denominator's Derivative**

Whenever the numerator is a linear (or less than quadratic) expression alongside a quadratic denominator, try to express the numerator as a combination of the derivative of the denominator and a constant. For example:

For \( \int \frac{px + q}{ax^2 + bx + c} dx \), set \( px + q = A \frac{d}{dx}(ax^2 + bx + c) + B \), then solve for A and B by equating coefficients. Now split the integral into two: one involving \( \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \) (which is \( \log |f(x)| \)), and the other is reduced to the standard forms discussed above.

**Partial Fraction Decomposition**

In some cases, particularly when integrating rational expressions whose denominator factors into linear/quadratic terms, use partial fraction decomposition to split the integral into a sum of simpler fractions. Each can then be integrated using basic or standard techniques described above.



## D. Examples for Practice

**Step-by-Step Example Solving**

For instance:

(i) \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 - 16} \) 
Complete the square: \( x^2 - 16 = (x - 4)(x + 4) \). Use the standard result for \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 - a^2} \), which gives:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \log \left| \frac{x - 4}{x + 4} \right| + C \]

(ii) \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 - 2x + 2} \) 
Complete the square: \( x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1 \).
Use the standard result for \( \int \frac{dx}{x^2 + a^2} \) after substitution, so answer is:
\[ \tan^{-1}(x - 1) + C \ ]

(iii) \( \int \frac{x + 2}{2x^2 + 6x + 5} dx \) 
Express numerator as derivative + constant:
x + 2 = \( \frac{1}{4}(4x + 6) + (2 - \frac{6}{4}) = \frac{1}{4}(4x + 6) + \frac{1}{2} \).
Set up integrals accordingly; split, substitute, and use standard integrals as explained.
