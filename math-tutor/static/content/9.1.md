## Introduction to Differential Equations

**Core Idea**

In calculus, differentiation is the process of finding the derivative f'(x) of a function f(x) with respect to x, indicating the rate of change. Integral calculus is the reverse process: given a function g(x), find another function f(x) such that the derivative dy/dx = g(x). Expanding this idea leads us to consider equations where the derivative of an unknown function is related to other functions or derivatives. Such equations that involve unknown functions and their derivatives are called differential equations.



## Definition and Identification of Differential Equations

**What is a Differential Equation?**

A differential equation is any equation that contains the derivative (or derivatives) of an unknown dependent variable (commonly y) with respect to one or more independent variables (commonly x). Unlike algebraic equations, differential equations include terms involving dy/dx, d²y/dx², etc. For example, the equation dy/dx = g(x) is a simple differential equation where the derivative of y with respect to x equals some function g(x). Equations without derivatives, like x² - 3x + 3 = 0 or sin x + cos x = 0, are not differential equations.



## Types of Differential Equations: Ordinary vs Partial

**Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)**

An ordinary differential equation involves derivatives of the unknown function with respect to only one independent variable. For example, \( 3 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \) is an ODE since the derivatives are only with respect to x.

**Partial Differential Equations (PDE)**

When derivatives with respect to more than one independent variable appear, the equation is a partial differential equation. For instance, \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 \) involves derivatives in both x and y. This content focuses on ordinary differential equations only.



## Notation for Derivatives

**Prime Notations**

The first derivative of y with respect to x can be written as y' or \( \frac{dy}{dx} \). The second derivative is y'' or \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \), and the third derivative as y''' or \( \frac{d^3y}{dx^3} \).

**nth Derivative Notation**

For derivatives of order higher than three, it becomes unwieldy to use multiple primes. Hence, the notation y^{(n)} or \( \frac{d^n y}{dx^n} \) is used to represent the nth derivative of y with respect to x.



## Order of a Differential Equation

**Definition of Order**

The order of a differential equation is the order (i.e., the highest degree of differentiation) of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable present in the equation. This is always a positive integer.

**Examples**

Given the equation \( \frac{dy}{dx} = e^x \), since the highest order derivative is the first derivative dy/dx, the order is 1. For \( \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0 \), the highest derivative is second order, so order = 2. Similarly, \( \frac{d^3 y}{dx^3} + 2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = 0 \) is third order.



## Degree of a Differential Equation

**Definition of Degree**

Degree of a differential equation is defined only if the equation is a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., the derivatives appear in polynomial forms without fractional or transcendental powers. It is the highest power (exponent) to which the highest order derivative is raised in the equation, and it must be a positive integer.

**Key Notes**

If the equation includes derivatives raised to fractional powers, or if derivatives appear inside transcendental functions like sine, cosine, exponential, etc., the degree is not defined.

**Examples**

The equation \( (\frac{d^3 y}{dx^3})^2 + (\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2})^3 - \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \) is a polynomial in derivatives; the highest order derivative is third order and is squared, so the degree is 2. The equation \( \sin(\frac{dy}{dx}) + y = 0 \) involves sine of dy/dx, not a polynomial form, so degree is not defined.



## Examples and Practice on Order and Degree

**Example 1**

Find order and degree of the following:

(i) \( \cos x - \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \)

- Highest order derivative: dy/dx (first order)
- Polynomial in derivative? Yes, degree of dy/dx is 1
- Order: 1, Degree: 1

(ii) \( x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y (\frac{dy}{dx})^2 - x y = 0 \)

- Highest order derivative: \( \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} \) (second order)
- The equation is polynomial in derivatives
- Degree is the highest power of highest order derivative term: \( \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} \) appears to first power
- Order: 2, Degree: 1

(iii) \( y^{(4)} + y + e^x = 0 \)

- Highest derivative: fourth order
- The equation is not polynomial in derivatives because of e^x
- Degree is not defined
- Order: 4
