## Inverse Relationship Between Differentiation and Integration

**Core Idea**

Integration and differentiation are inverse processes. If F(x) is an antiderivative (indefinite integral) of f(x), then differentiating F(x) brings you back to f(x), and integrating f(x) brings you to F(x) (plus a constant). Mathematically: d/dx [∫ f(x) dx] = f(x) and ∫ f′(x) dx = f(x) + C, where C is an arbitrary constant. This establishes that integrating and differentiating 'cancel' each other.

**Proof and Notation**

Suppose F(x) is any function such that F′(x) = f(x). Then, ∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C. So, d/dx [∫ f(x) dx] = d/dx [F(x) + C] = F′(x) = f(x). Similarly, since if g(x) = f′(x), then ∫ g(x) dx = f(x) + C.

**Constant of Integration**

The '+C' term arises because the derivative of a constant is zero, so any family of functions differing by a constant are valid antiderivatives.



## Equivalence of Indefinite Integrals with the Same Derivative

**Statement and Implication**

If two functions have the same derivative, their indefinite integrals (families of antiderivatives) differ by at most a constant. That is, if the derivatives of two integrals are equal, the integrals represent the same set of functions, up to a constant.

**Mathematical Proof**

Suppose (d/dx)[∫ f(x) dx] = (d/dx)[∫ g(x) dx]. Hence, ∫ f(x) dx – ∫ g(x) dx = C (some constant). Thus, ∫ f(x) dx = ∫ g(x) dx + C. Therefore, both families of antiderivatives are essentially identical.

**Practical Use**

This property ensures you can match antiderivative results (even if they look different), as long as they differ only by an additive constant.



## Linearity – Sum Property of Indefinite Integrals

**Property Statement**

The indefinite integral of the sum of two (or more) functions equals the sum of their indefinite integrals: ∫ [f(x) + g(x)] dx = ∫ f(x) dx + ∫ g(x) dx. This is called the linearity property.

**Proof**

By the derivative property, d/dx [∫ (f(x) + g(x)) dx] = f(x) + g(x). Also, d/dx [∫ f(x) dx + ∫ g(x) dx] = f(x) + g(x). Therefore, the LHS and RHS are antiderivatives of the same function, differing at most by a constant, making the equality valid.

**Multiple Functions**

This property generalizes to any finite sum: ∫ [f₁(x) + f₂(x) + ... + fₙ(x)] dx = ∫ f₁(x) dx + ∫ f₂(x) dx + ... + ∫ fₙ(x) dx.



## Homogeneity – Constant Multiple Property

**Property Statement**

The indefinite integral of a constant multiple of a function equals the constant times the indefinite integral of the function: ∫ k·f(x) dx = k·∫ f(x) dx, where k is a real constant.

**Proof**

Following the derivative rules: d/dx [∫ k f(x) dx] = k f(x); also, d/dx [k ∫ f(x) dx] = k f(x). So both sides represent antiderivatives of k f(x), differing at most by a constant.

**Generalization**

This property also extends to finite sums with different constants: ∫ [k₁f₁(x) + k₂f₂(x) + ... + kₙfₙ(x)] dx = k₁∫ f₁(x) dx + k₂∫ f₂(x) dx + ... + kₙ∫ fₙ(x) dx.



## Integration by Inspection (Antiderivative by Guessing)

**Method**

Rather than using standard formulae, sometimes you can guess an antiderivative by thinking about which function, when differentiated, would give you the integrand. This is called integration by inspection and is useful for simpler expressions.

**Examples**

1. ∫ cos(2x) dx: Since d/dx [sin(2x)] = 2 cos(2x), the antiderivative is (1/2) sin(2x). 2. ∫ (3x² + 4x³) dx: Since d/dx [x³ + x⁴] = 3x² + 4x³, the antiderivative is x³ + x⁴. 3. ∫ (1/x) dx: The derivative of log(x) is 1/x (for x > 0), so the antiderivative is log|x|.

**Technique**

Look for patterns or recall standard derivatives to guess the function whose derivative is the integrand.



## Application of Properties: Examples

**Example Problem Set 1**

Evaluate ∫ (3x² – 1) dx. Using linearity, separate into ∫ 3x² dx – ∫ 1 dx. Integrate each term: (3/3)x³ – x + C = x³ – x + C.

**Example Problem Set 2**

Evaluate ∫ (sin x + cos x) dx. Integrate term-wise: ∫ sin x dx + ∫ cos x dx = –cos x + sin x + C.



## Remarks and Notes

**Infinite Family of Antiderivatives**

If F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), so is F(x) + C for any constant C.

**Unique Antiderivative (Initial Value Problems)**

If you are given an initial condition (e.g., F(0) = 3), you can determine the specific value of C to find a unique antiderivative.

**Function Not Expressible in Terms of Elementary Functions**

Not all functions have antiderivatives expressible in terms of elementary functions (e.g., ∫ e^(–x²) dx). In such cases, other methods or special functions might be required.

**Variable of Integration**

If integration is with respect to a variable other than x (say, t), integral formulae are modified accordingly, but properties remain the same.
