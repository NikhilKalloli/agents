## Introduction to Partial Fractions

**Core Idea**

Integration by partial fractions is a method used to integrate rational functions—the ratio of two polynomials—by expressing them as a sum of simpler fractions. Each of these simpler terms has an easily integrable form. The main advantage is that while integrating the complicated original function may be difficult, integrating the decomposed simpler fractions becomes straightforward.

**Motivation for the Method**

Direct integration of a rational function, especially when the denominator is factorable, is usually complex. By decomposing into partial fractions, each part can be integrated using elementary techniques such as logarithmic and inverse trigonometric forms.



## Types of Rational Functions: Proper and Improper

**Definition of Proper and Improper Functions**

A rational function is proper if the degree of the numerator, P(x), is less than the degree of the denominator, Q(x). Otherwise, it is considered improper. For instance, (2x+1)/(x^2+3x+2) is proper, but (x^3+2x+1)/(x^2-5x+6) is improper as the numerator's degree is higher.

**Handling Improper Functions**

Improper rational functions must be reduced to proper form before applying partial fractions. This is done by dividing the numerator by the denominator via long division, yielding a polynomial plus a proper fraction, which can then be decomposed.



## Reduction of Improper Rational Functions

**Long Division Process**

Perform polynomial long division: Divide P(x) by Q(x), yielding a quotient T(x) (a polynomial) and a remainder P1(x). The original function becomes T(x) + P1(x)/Q(x), where P1(x)/Q(x) is a proper rational function ready for decomposition. Example: (x^2+1)/(x^2-5x+6) becomes (1 + 5x-5)/(x^2-5x+6) after division.



## Concept of Partial Fraction Decomposition

**Decomposition Principle**

A proper rational function with a denominator factorable into linear and quadratic terms can be written as the sum of partial fractions, each corresponding to the form of the denominator's factors.

**Why Decomposition Works**

Any rational function with a denominator split into linear (e.g., (x-a)) and irreducible quadratic (e.g., x^2+bx+c) factors can be represented as a sum of terms whose denominators are these factors, and numerators are constants or degree-poorer polynomials. The coefficients (A, B, etc.) are to be determined by algebraic methods.



## Forms of Partial Fractions (Table 7.2)

**Forms Corresponding to Denominator Types**

The type of factors in the denominator dictates the form of partial fractions:
- For non-repeating linear factors: A/(x-a) + B/(x-b)
- For repeated linear factors: A/(x-a) + B/(x-a)^2
- For multiple linear factors: A/(x-a) + B/(x-b) + C/(x-c)
- For an irreducible quadratic factor: (Ax+B)/(x^2+bx+c)
- Mixtures and higher multiplicities are handled by summing appropriate terms for each factor and power.

**Table 7.2 Reference**

Table 7.2 (as given) provides the mappings:
1. 	\(\frac{p(x)}{(x-a)(x-b)} = \frac{A}{x-a} + \frac{B}{x-b}, a \neq b\)
2. 	\(\frac{p(x)}{(x-a)^2} = \frac{A}{x-a} + \frac{B}{(x-a)^2}\)
3. 	\(\frac{p(x)}{(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)} = \frac{A}{x-a} + \frac{B}{x-b} + \frac{C}{x-c}\)
4. 	\(\frac{p(x)}{(x-a)(x^2+bx+c)} = \frac{A}{x-a} + \frac{Bx+C}{x^2+bx+c}\)
5. 	For irreducible quadratics: \(\frac{p(x)}{x^2+bx+c} = \frac{Ax+B}{x^2+bx+c}\) when it cannot be factorised further.



## Step-by-step Solution to Example Problems

**Example 11: Simple Linear Denominator Factors**

Integrate \(\int \frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)}dx\).
- Express as \(\frac{A}{x+1} + \frac{B}{x+2}\), solve for A, B:
\(1 = A(x+2) + B(x+1)\). Equate coefficients: \(A+B=0, 2A+B=1\).\
Solve: \(A=1, B=-1\).
Integrate: \(\int\left(\frac{1}{x+1} - \frac{1}{x+2}\right) dx = \ln|x+1| - \ln|x+2| + C\), combine logs as \(\ln\left|\frac{x+1}{x+2}\right| + C\).

**Example 12: Improper Rational Function**

Given \(\int \frac{x^2+1}{x^2-5x+6}dx\), as numerator's degree ≥ denominator, perform long division:
\(x^2+1 = 1 \times (x^2-5x+6) + (5x-5)\). Thus,
\(\frac{x^2+1}{x^2-5x+6} = 1 + \frac{5x-5}{x^2-5x+6}\).
Decompose \(\frac{5x-5}{(x-2)(x-3)}\) as \(\frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-3}\). Find A, B, then integrate each term individually.

**Example 13: Denominator with Repeated and Multiple Linear Factors**

For \(\int \frac{3x-2}{(x+1)(x+3)^2}dx\), decompose as:
\(\frac{A}{x+1} + \frac{B}{x+3} + \frac{C}{(x+3)^2}\).
Expand and equate coefficients to solve for A, B, C. Once obtained, integrate each term using basic logarithmic and power rules.

**Example 14: Denominator with Quadratic Terms and Using Substitution**

Given \(\int \frac{x^2}{x^2+1)(x^2+4)}dx\), use substitution \(x^2 = y, dx = \frac{dy}{2\sqrt{y}}\) if needed, or decompose \(\frac{y}{(y+1)(y+4)}\). Find A, B such that \(\frac{y}{(y+1)(y+4)} = \frac{A}{y+1} + \frac{B}{y+4}\). Integrate as sums of logarithms, and revert substitution.

**Example 15: Partial Fractions Coupled with Trigonometric Substitution**

For \(\int \frac{3\sin\varphi-2}{5\cos\varphi-4\sin\varphi-2}d\varphi\), use substitution \(y=\sin\varphi\), \(dy=\cos\varphi d\varphi\). Express denominator in y, decompose, solve for A, B, integrate, and revert substitution for the final expression.

**Example 16: Denominator with Quadratic Irreducible Factor**

Here, \(\int \frac{x^2+x+1}{(x^2+1)(x+2)}dx\), set up partial fractions \(\frac{A}{x+2} + \\frac{Bx+C}{x^2+1}\), equate coefficients by comparing both sides, solve the system for A, B, C, integrate each piece (logs for linear, arctan for quadratic), and combine.



## Special Notes on Partial Fraction Problems

**Mathematical Identities in Decomposition**

Recall that the decomposed equation in partial fractions is an algebraic identity for all values of x where denominators are defined (not just for specific x). Sometimes authors use '≡' instead of '=' to indicate this identity.

**Strategic Substitution**

In many problems, especially with trigonometric or quadratic expressions, strategic substitution before or after decomposition can greatly simplify the integration process.

**Multiple Methods May Apply**

Sometimes, integration after decomposition may still require additional techniques such as substitution, integration by parts, or recognizing standard forms leading to logarithmic or inverse trigonometric results.
